# Hi :)

This is the server side for the app 'Purple House'.

[For Client side](https://github.com/trynx/purple_house_client)

This is an Express Nodejs server which connects to MongoDB with mongoose.

# Run server

## Regular

Use `npm run watch` to run the server with nodemon.

## Debugging

If you're using VS code, just run F5(debugging), and it will run the `npm run watch` command and attach a debugger.

# Run MongoDB

After you have the local MongoDB installed, run `npm run dbon`
